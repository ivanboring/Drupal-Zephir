This is just a small test module to test functionality of each function 
as well as speed and memory consumption.

Installation:
1. Enable the module
2. Goto /zephirtest
3. If you want json output instead add ?json=true

Notice that you have to install the drupal.so in your conf.d as well as 
exchange the includes directory of drupal to test the Zephir functionality
