# Drupal-Zephir
Drupal + Zephir

Small test merging some function from Drupal with Zephir

/drupal includes the directory for the Drupal 7.34 include files as well as a module for testing the functions that has been ported

/scripts includes the source code files for Zephir

/compare has a file that you can setup and run via cli or the website to compare two drupal instances (I use this with Jenkins for testing)
